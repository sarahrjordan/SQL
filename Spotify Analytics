/*Spotify*/
/*For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
The data includes the top 50 songs listened to in 2021 on Spotify.
Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into, and performed analytics on the data using SQL.*/

id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,

key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL);

Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, you need to show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”. 
How would you do this using a CTE?
HINT: The CTE portion of the query should answer the first part of the question (average popularity for the artists in the table). 
The query that follows the CTE should select the information FROM the CTE that's needed, and also add a "Top Star" tag.*/
