/*7.
For each continent, show the continent and number of countries with populations of at least 10 million.*/
select continent, count(name) from world where population>=10000000 group by continent

/*8.
List the continents that have a total population of at least 100 million.*/
select continent from world group by continent having sum(population) >=100000000
