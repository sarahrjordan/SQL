/*In this project, I downloaded a database containing data points from Netflix. I used PostgreSQL to answer questions about the data.
One table has information about people in Netflix content (director, cast, etc.).
Another table has information about details of Netflix content (title, type of content whether show or movie, release date, etc.).*/

/*First explore the data for general familiarity:*/
select * from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" limit 5;
select * from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" limit 5;

/*Q1 How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)*/
select count(*) from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type='Movie';

/*Q2 When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?*/
select type from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" group by type;
select max(date(date_added))
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

/*Q3 List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.*/
select title, type from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
order by title asc;

/*Q4 Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?*/
select p.director, t.title from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" as t
left join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" as p 
on t.show_id=p.show_id
where t.title='Bright Star';

/*Q5 What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?*/
select title, release_year 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type = 'Movie'
and release_year <= 
(select min(release_year) 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type = 'Movie');
