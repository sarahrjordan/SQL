/*In this code, I'm using two tables of data on Netflix people (director, cast, etc.), and Netflix content (title, type of content whether
show or movie, release date, etc.) to answer questions about the data*/

/*First explore the data for general familiarity:*/
select * from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" limit 5;
select * from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" limit 5;

/*Next pull a few columns from both tables in one query after joining people table and titles table:*/
select p.director, t.title, t.rating
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" as p
full outer join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" as t
on p.show_id = t.show_id;

/*Q1) How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)*/
select count(*) from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type='Movie';

/*Q2) When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?*/
select type from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" group by type;
select max(date(date_added))
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

/*Q3) List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.*/
select title, type from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
order by title asc;

/*Q4) Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?*/
select p.director, t.title from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" as t
left join "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" as p 
on t.show_id=p.show_id
where t.title='Bright Star';

/*Q5) What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?*/
select title, release_year 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
where type = 'Movie'
and release_year <= 
(select min(release_year) 
from "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
